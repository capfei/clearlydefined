# Technical Road Map for ClearlyDefined

There are three major pillars for ClearlyDefined technical work.

![Three Pillars of the Technical Roadmap](/assets/images/technical-roadmap-3-pillars.png)

## Data Quality

### License Data Quality

* reduce missing licenses
  * pass through ScanCode LicenseRef
  * reduce the number of licenses identified as NOASSERTION/OTHER
* accurate license data
  * improve the human curation process for licenses
  * report of complex licenses to identify licenses for human review
* improve license coverage by adding support for more package managers with potential candidates...
  * Dartâ€™s pub
  * GitHub Actions
  * Support for purl (in search)
  * identify additional package managers

### Attributions Data Quality

* accurate attribution data
  * improve the human curation process for attributions
  * report of attributions not following the expected pattern to identify attributions for human review

### UI Usability Improvements

* redesign UI (e.g. functional workflows for curations, searching for definitions)
* implement proposed UI design
* bug fixes

_NOTE: Curations through the UI lead directly to data quality improvements._

## Performance

### Improve Crawler Throughput

* determine the cause of current poor performance
* explore improvements to concurrency in code
* determine level of horizontal scaling needed to support demand on the queue
* support other entities setting up crawlers on their hardware
* update queue processing to support a secondary queue set that a crawler draws from when their primary queue is empty
* add better monitoring, examples...
  * alerts when crawler requests fail at a rate > 10 per hour
  * alerts when crawler queue size > 1 million
  * alerts when harvest queue processes < 3 requests in an hour
  * count of requests processed per hour
  * count of requests failing per hour
  * count of requests that timeout

### Improve API Performance

* support higher rate limits for API requests
* explore why requests are denied before current rate limits are met

## Sustainability

### Code Sustainability

* keep license detection tools on the latest version
* regular dependency updates

### DevOps & Infrastructure

* make it easier to deploy at a more frequent cadence
  * move deploys to GitHub Actions
  * document release and deploy process
  * expand integration tests
  * document manual checks to perform after a deploy
* evaluate current hardware to determine if upgrades are needed

### Documentation

* modernize current documentation by moving to Docusaurus

### Collaborators

* identify potential collaborators
* establish good issue management
  * add issues for roadmap items
  * triage older issues, closing as appropriate
  * add `Good First Issue` label to appropriate issues

## Requested and Considering

* trust score for license human curations where score increases with the number of institutions that have reviewed the data
